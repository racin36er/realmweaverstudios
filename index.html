                    <p><span class="pcontent">Welcome to Realmweaver Studios! Founded in 2024, Realmweaver is a small indie game developer based in Canada.
                        We are currently working on developing our first game, using the working title <a href="projects.html"><em>Mystic Masters</em></a>, which is an innovative
                        2D MMORPG in which players must master myth and commerce, balance divine powers, build up their city, practice economic strategies
                        and more to ensure the survival of their realm.
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        The game is currently in the paper phase, as we complete initial designs and finish ironing out the idea. The intention is to live
                        stream development of the game on Twitch, which we will begin doing once coding has begun. In the mean time, feel free to check us out
